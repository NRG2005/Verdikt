    Write a short, clear paragraph (3-4 sentences maximum) validating this decision and explaining exactly WHY this transaction violates the cited regulation.
    - Avoid technical jargon.
    - Write it so a human analyst can immediately understand the core issue.
    - Do NOT output any JSON, just the paragraph text.
